## Description

This application allows a user to take notes on their PC or mobile device and have the ability to return to the application with their notes still persisting. This application helps eliminate having to jot down notes with a pen and paper and potentially losing the note. The user can save as much notes as they want to the application but also have the ability to delete them as needed. This is a lightweight application that utilizes front-end and back-end operations.

## Application

-Application is deployed on Heroku and is ready to use.

## Usage

The user can use the application that is deployed on heroku. There is no need to install anything else to start using this application. The application uses a series of routes to serve a template index page and notes page. The backend takes the data the from the users input and converts it to an object array in a JSON database. The JSON data is then read by the express.js framework and is inserted to the template html pages. These pages are then served to the client side broswer and all the notes notated from the input field are visibly stored on a separate column. The user can also delete notes as needed by click the trash icon next to the associated note. The object array is then also deleted from the JSON database.
